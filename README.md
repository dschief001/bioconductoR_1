# bioconductoR_1
code repository, to turn into a package soon

This reporsitory should indicate my coding way.

## Shiny app

This is found within the folder FA_Explorer

It contains a Shiny app, which visualized the respective FA profiles for different mouse tissues, calculated with the bioconductor going to be package in mind.
This should be a working example, and it is, if run within the Rstudio project, found in the main folder.
* This shiny app visualizes the Artificial neural network, trained to predict the underlying Cardiolipin fatty acyl profile on basis of the cellular Lipid pool, as described in https://www.cell.com/cell-reports/fulltext/S2211-1247(20)30296-5.

## The additional code is part of our inhouse pipeline to integrate samples

This also contains the code for modelling the MS2 spectra.Although in this approach for PLs and not CLs.
Further info is happily provided upon request ;)
